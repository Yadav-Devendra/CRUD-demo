# Spring Boot & React CRUD Application

This project is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot for the backend API and React for the frontend user interface. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates a basic CRUD implementation, allowing users to perform the following operations:

*   **Create:** Add new data entries.
*   **Read:** View existing data entries.
*   **Update:** Modify existing data entries.
*   **Delete:** Remove data entries.

The project is structured into two main components:

*   **`backend` (Spring Boot):**  Handles API requests, data validation, business logic, and database interactions.
*   **`frontend` (React):** Provides the user interface for interacting with the application, making API calls to the backend, and displaying data.
